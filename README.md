‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

**Data Preprocessing**:
- Remove unnecessary characters and special symbols.
- Convert text to lowercase and clean up whitespace.
**Visualization**:
- Analyze genre distribution and most frequent words using seaborn.
**Feature Extraction**:
- Convert text data into numerical features using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer.
**Model Training**:
- Train models like Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and SVC using the processed data.
**Evaluation**:
- Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
